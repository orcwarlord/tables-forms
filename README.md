# HTML Tables and Forms

1. Create an HTML table that will display the following data.

**Population of Countries in the UK** 
     
 |  Country |  Capital City |  Population | 
 |----------|---------------|-------------| 
 |  England |  London |  54,786,300 |  
 |  Scotland |  Edinburgh |  5,404,700 |  
 |  Wales |  Cardiff |  3,063,456 |  
 |  N. Ireland |   Belfast |  1,870,451 |  

* Validate the page.
* Add some CSS to this file so that the table cells and table header are coloured.
* England has the highest population. Using CSS can you find a way of colouring the England row in a different colour to the other rows of the table? 

2.
    * Download file [carboot.html](carboot.html). *carboot.html* is a registration questionnaire for a fictional e-commerce Web Site. 
    * Using this as a basis, create a web page that structures this information as an HTML form. 
    * You will see that some of the questions have various options as answers, others do not. Using your knowledge of HTML select which form elements are appropriate for each question and generate a complete form. 
        * Try to use a range of elements
        * Make sure you validate the page. 
    * Add some CSS to style the form elements. Here is some advice:
        * You may need to put each pair of label and input elements inside *div* tags.
        * You may need to change the *display* property for the form controls to move them onto separate lines.
        * You may need to use the attribute selector in CSS to style specific types of form element e.g. radio buttons?
